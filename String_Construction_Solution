"""
Amanda has a string of lowercase letters that she wants to copy to a new string. She can perform the following operations with the given costs. She can perform them any number of times to construct a new string:
1. Append a character to the end of string s at a cost of a dollars.
2. Choose any substring of s and append it to the end of s at no charge.
For example, given the string s = 'abcd', it can be copied for 4 dollars. Start by copying 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' individually at a cost of 1 dollar per character. String 'abcd' at this time. Copy 'abc' to the end of 'abcd' at no cost to complete the copy.
